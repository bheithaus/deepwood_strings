    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <div class="span6">
        <p>
            The Deepwood String quartet, first started in 1984, has always been
            made up of musicians who met in the Salem Chamber Orchestra. As well
            as being professional musicians, they have always been great
            friends. For years, they have gone on an annual musical retreat
            together, playing quartets for hours. During the pandemic, they
            continued playing in a garage (with the door open), socially
            distanced, masked and huddled next to personal propane heaters. They
            played weekly throughout the seasons (even winter) of 2020-21 and
            entertained walkers and bikers who happened by.

        <h4>Julie Rundquist</h4>
				<p>Julie Rundquist graduated from the University of Missouri-Columbia with a B.S. in Education (Vocal and Instrumental Music) where she studied with members of the Esterhazy String Quartet. Julie performed in the first violin section of the Boise Philharmonic for nine years before moving to Oregon. After nine years of teaching orchestra and general music in Missouri, Idaho, and Salem, Julie received her Masters Degree in Elementary Education from Western Oregon University. For the last fourteen years she has taught kindergarten, first grade, and currently teaches fourth grade for Salem Keizer Schools.</p>
        <p>A highlight of Julie's career was performing music by Aaron Copland while being conducted by the composer.  Her favorite part about being a musician is being part of a work of art where everyone plays a part in painting a beautiful texture through very close teamwork! You actually feel like you are a real, live part of the painting when performing because the colors of sound surround you. It is an amazing experience. It is truly a privilege to be able to make music with your dearest friends and perform in your community.</p>

        <h4>Rhonda Johnson</h4>
				<p>Rhonda Johnson, cellist, has played in Salem Chamber Orchestra since its founding, and had played in the Salem Symphony before that. She has also plays with Festival Chorale, Cello Connection, Linfield Chamber Orchestra, and Deepwood Strings. She currently works at the Department of Justice.</p>
        <p>Some of the influential experiences from her youth that led her to become a musician were her parents.  Both of her parents were musicians. Her father was the first band teacher at South Salem, a composer, choir director, and played in jazz bands; her mother was a piano teacher, organist and cellist. All their friends were musicians and playing an instrument a major part of the family lifestyle.</p>
        <p>It seems like every concert has incredible moments, but the biggest experience for Rhonda was playing the Mozart Requiem at Mt. Angel Abby after 9/11/01.</p>
        <p>For Rhonda, one of the best things about being a musician is the people you get to work with, in the quartet, in the orchestra and behind the scenes. It’s always been a privilege and a blessing to be able to work with them.  Outside of her teachers and family, the musicians she's known for many years have been influential on her life; Diane McLin, Bruce and Valerie McIntosh, Cathy Heithaus, Georgienne Young to name only a few. Oh, and don't forget Beethoven – he’s been a major mentor to her as well!</p>

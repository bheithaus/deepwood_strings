                    I cannot believe that a week has passed already since the
                    wedding! Our thanks to you & Jenny for your beautiful music,
                    which I am now able to enjoy as a thoughtful friend took a
                    video of the afternoon's events, so I can actually listen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thank you also for taking the time to meet with us & help us
                    choose the music. Include us on your list of VERY happy
                    clients.
                </p>

                    The success of the Salem Chamber Orchestra Garden Party was
                    greatly enhanced by the beautiful music performed by the
                    wonderful musicians of the Deepwood Strings. As I told the
                    gathered patrons and friends of the SCO, I never thought I
                    could have such a wonderful experience in my own garden.
                    Thank you to all of you.

                    The women of Deepwood Strings provided a wonderful classical
                    backdrop for Willamette's 2013 Master of Arts in Teaching
                    Commencement ceremony, including rousing processional and
                    recessional selections that could not have been better
                    chosen. Professional beyond par, they will be our first
                    choice for 2014 Commencement as well. This respected
                    ensemble can be trusted to be punctual and fun, easy to work
                    with, and to select music perfectly suited to the occasion
                    and venue. They are a delight.

                    Our daughter's wedding was even more beautiful with the
                    amazing music that Cathy, of Deepwood Strings, created.
                    Working with Cathy was so easy, as she had so many ideas for
                    music selections. Cathy is an outstanding musician,
                    professional, and friendly. I would recommend her to anyone
                    that wants top-notch talent at their event.

                    We had the pleasure of working with Jenny and Cathy of
                    Deepwood Strings in November 2012 for our wedding day. While
                    their musical talent added the ambiance and intimacy we
                    desired for our wedding day, one of our favorite parts of
                    the planning process was meeting for them both for a
                    pre-wedding planning session. We were welcomed into Cathy's
                    home and had the pleasure of listening to Cathy and Jenny
                    play their strings and choosing our wedding processional and
                    ceremony music during the in-home concert. What a gift to
                    have that personal experience and feel a connectedness to
                    those involved in our wedding day. From initial
                    communication to the actual wedding day, Jenny and Cathy
                    were the perfect fit for us. We highly recommend their
                    talent, expertise and heart for any event.

                    I received so many wonderful comments from our guests about
                    how fabulous the music was. I do believe you were the high

                    Five years ago I heard a beautiful waltz with violin and
                    guitar. Recently I asked Cathy if she could perform it for
                    my wedding anniversary. Though she couldn't find sheet music
                    for it, she and her husband played it perfectly, note for
                    note, and with all the feeling that I loved in the original
                    piece. It was a very memorable moment. Thanks Cathy!

    		  <p>The women of Deepwood Strings provided a wonderful classical backdrop for Willamette's 2013 Master of Arts in Teaching Commencement ceremony, including rousing processional and recessional selections that could not have been better chosen.  Professional beyond par, they will be our first choice for 2014 Commencement as well.  This respected ensemble can be trusted to be punctual and fun, easy to work with, and to select music perfectly suited to the occasion and venue.  They are a delight.</p>

    		  <p>Our daughter's wedding was even more beautiful with the amazing music that Cathy, of Deepwood Strings, created. Working with Cathy was so easy, as she had so many ideas for music selections. Cathy is an outstanding musician, professional, and friendly.
        I would  recommend her to anyone that wants top-notch talent at their event.</p>

    		  <p>We had the pleasure of working with Jenny and Cathy of Deepwood Strings in November 2012 for our wedding day. While their musical talent added the ambiance and intimacy we desired for our wedding day, one of our favorite parts of the planning process was meeting for them both for a pre-wedding planning session. We were welcomed into Cathy's home and had the pleasure of listening to Cathy and Jenny play their strings and choosing our wedding processional and ceremony music during the in-home concert. What a gift to have that personal experience and feel a connectedness to those involved in our wedding day. From initial communication to the actual wedding day, Jenny and Cathy were the perfect fit for us. We highly recommend their talent, expertise and heart for any event.</p>

		  <p>We had the pleasure of working with Jenny and Cathy of Deepwood Strings in November 2012 for our wedding day. While their musical talent added the ambiance and intimacy we desired for our wedding day, one of our favorite parts of the planning process was meeting for them both for a pre-wedding planning session. We were welcomed into Cathy's home and had the pleasure of listening to Cathy and Jenny play their strings and choosing our wedding processional and ceremony music during the in-home concert. What a gift to have that personal experience and feel a connectedness to those involved in our wedding day. From initial communication to the actual wedding day, Jenny and Cathy were the perfect fit for us. We highly recommend their talent, expertise and heart for any event.</p>
